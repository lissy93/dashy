## Setting up the Dev Environment

### Prerequisites

You will need either the latest or LTS version of **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** to build and serve the application and **[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)** to easily fetch the code, and push any changes. If you plan on running or deploying the container, you'll also need **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)**. To avoid any unexpected issues, ensure you've got at least **[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)** V 7.5 or **[Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)** 1.22 (you may find [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) helpful for switching/ managing versions).

### Running the Project

1. Get Code: `git clone https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy.git`
2. Navigate into the directory: `cd dashy`
3. Install dependencies: `yarn`
4. Start dev server: `yarn dev`

Dashy should now be being served on <http://localhost:8080/>. Hot reload is enabled, so making changes to any of the files will trigger them to be rebuilt and the page refreshed.

### Project Commands

#### Basics

- **`yarn build`** - Builds the production bundle into `./dist`. The Vite dev/runtime server serves `user-data/conf.yml` on each request, so a rebuild is only needed when source code or assets change, not when config changes
- **`yarn start`** - Starts the Node server, which serves the built site from `./dist` and the live config from `user-data/`. Run `yarn build` first

#### Development

- **`yarn dev`** - Starts the development server with hot reloading
- **`yarn lint`** - Lints code to ensure it follows a consistent, neat style
- **`yarn test`** - Runs tests, and outputs results

#### Utils and Checks

- **`yarn validate-config`** - If you have quite a long configuration file, you may wish to check that it's all good to go, before deploying the app. This can be done with `yarn validate-config` or `docker exec -it [container-id] yarn validate-config`. Your config file needs to be in `/user-data/conf.yml` (or within your Docker container at `/app/user-data/conf.yml`). This will first check that your YAML is valid, and then validates it against Dashy's [schema](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/src/utils/config/ConfigSchema.json).
- **`yarn health-check`** - Checks that the application is up and running on it's specified port, and outputs current status and response times. Useful for integrating into your monitoring service, if you need to maintain high system availability

#### Alternate Start Commands

- **`yarn build && yarn start`** - Builds the app, then starts the production Node server. Use this for a manual production-style run on bare metal. With Vite, `conf.yml` is served from `user-data/` at runtime, so config changes only require a page refresh
- **`yarn pm2-start`** - Starts the Node server using [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/), a process manager for Node.js applications, that helps them stay alive. PM2 has some built-in basic monitoring features, and an optional [management solution](https://pm2.io/). If you are running the app on bare metal, it is recommended to use this start command

#### Notes

- If you are using NPM, replace `yarn` with `npm run`
- If you are using Docker, precede each command with `docker exec -it [container-id]`. Container ID can be found by running `docker ps`

### Environmental Variables

All environmental variables are optional. Currently there are not many environmental variables used, as most of the user preferences are stored under `appConfig` in the `conf.yml` file.

You can set variables either in your environment, or using the [`.env`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/.env) file.

- `NODE_ENV` - Current environment, can be either development, production or test
- `PORT` - The port to expose the running application on
- `HOST` - The address on which the HTTP and HTTPS servers listen. When unset, Node uses `::` if IPv6 is available, or `0.0.0.0` otherwise. On most systems `::` also accepts IPv4 connections. Set `HOST=0.0.0.0` to listen on IPv4 only, or a specific address to restrict the binding.
- `VITE_APP_DOMAIN` - The address of Dashy's server, if it's not the same as where the frontend is served from
- `INTEGRITY` - Should enable SRI for build script and link resources
- `IS_DOCKER` - Computed automatically on build. Indicates if running in container
- `VITE_APP_VERSION` - Again, set automatically using package.json during build time
- `BACKUP_DIR` - Directory for conf.yml backups
- `DISABLE_CONFIG_BACKUPS` - Set to 'true' to skip the pre-save backup step (useful on read-only filesystems or where permissions don't allow it)

### Environment Modes

You can set the environment using the `NODE_ENV` variable. By default, the correct environment should be selected based on the script you run to start the app. The following environments are supported: `production`, `development` and `test`. For more info, see [Vite Env Variables and Modes](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode).

## Git Strategy

### Git Flow

Like most Git repos, we are following the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow) standard.

1. Create a branch (or fork if you don'd have write access)
2. Code some awesome stuff 🧑‍💻
3. Add, commit and push your changes to your branch/ fork
4. Head over to GitHub and create a Pull Request
5. Fill in the required sections in the template, and hit submit
6. Follow up with any reviews on your code
7. Merge 🎉

### Git Branch Naming

The format of your branch name should be something similar to: `[TYPE]/[TICKET]_[TITLE]`
For example, `FEATURE/420_Awesome-feature` or `FIX/690_login-server-error`

### Commit Emojis

Using a single emoji at the start of each commit message, to indicate the type task, makes the commit ledger easier to understand, plus it looks cool.

### PR Guidelines

Once you've made your changes, and pushed them to your fork or branch, you're ready to open a pull request!

For a pull request to be merged, it must:

- Must be backwards compatible
- The build, lint and tests (run by GH actions) must pass
- There must not be any merge conflicts

When you submit your PR, include the required info, by filling out the PR template. Including:

- A brief description of your changes
- The issue, ticket or discussion number (if applicable)
- For UI relate updates include a screenshot
- If any dependencies were added, explain why it was needed, state the cost associated, and confirm it does not introduce any security issues
- Finally, check the checkboxes, to confirm that the standards are met, and hit submit!

## Resources for Beginners

New to Web Development? Glad you're here! Dashy is a pretty simple app, so it should make a good candidate for your first PR. Presuming that you already have a basic knowledge of JavaScript, the following articles should point you in the right direction for getting up to speed with the technologies used in this project:

- [Open Source for Beginners](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [Introduction to Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)
- [Vue.js Walkthrough](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-vue/)
- [ES6 Features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features)
- [Definitive guide to SCSS](https://blog.logrocket.com/the-definitive-guide-to-scss/)
- [Complete beginners guide to Docker](https://docker-curriculum.com/)
- [Docker Classroom - Interactive Tutorials](https://training.play-with-docker.com/)
- [Quick start TypeScript guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-typescript-in-5-minutes-13eda868daeb/)
- [Complete TypeScript tutorial series](https://www.typescripttutorial.net/)
- [Using TypeScript with Vue.js](https://blog.logrocket.com/vue-typescript-tutorial-examples/)
- [Git cheat sheet](http://git-cheatsheet.com/)
- [Basics of using NPM](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-npm-a-node-package-manager-tutorial-for-beginners/)

As well as Node, Git and Docker- you'll also need an IDE (e.g. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)) and a terminal (Windows users may find [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) more convenient).

## App Info

### Style Guide

Linting is done using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), and using the [Vue.js Styleguide](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-config-standard), which is very similar to the [AirBnB Styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). You can run `yarn lint` to report and fix issues. While the dev server is running, issues will be reported to the console automatically, and any lint errors will trigger the build to fail. Note that all lint checks must pass before any PR can be merged. Linting is also run as a git pre-commit hook

The most significant things to note are:

- Indentation should be done with two spaces
- Strings should use single quotes
- All statements must end in a semi-colon
- The final element in all objects must be preceded with a comma
- Maximum line length is 100
- There must be exactly one blank line between sections, before function names, and at the end of the file
- With conditionals, put else on the same line as your if block's closing brace
- All multiline blocks must use braces
- Avoid console statements in the frontend

Styleguides:

- Vue: [Vue styleguide](https://vuejs.org/style-guide/)
- JavaScript: [github.com/airbnb/javascript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

## Development Tools

### Performance - Lighthouse

The easiest method of checking performance is to use Chromium's build in auditing tool, Lighthouse. To run the test, open Developer Tools (usually F12) --> Lighthouse and click on the 'Generate Report' button at the bottom.

### Dependencies - BundlePhobia

[BundlePhobia](https://bundlephobia.com/) is a really useful app that lets you analyze the cost of adding any particular dependency to an application


`WARN asset size limit: The following asset(s) exceed the recommended size limit (244 KiB).` - For the PWA to support Windows 10, a splash screen asset is required, and is quite large. This throws a warning, however PWA assets are not loaded until needed, so shouldn't have any impact on application performance. A similar warning is thrown for the Raleway font, and that is looking to be addressed.
